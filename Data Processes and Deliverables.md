# Processes - Data Science, Data Mining, Machine Learning, AI, Advanced Analytics

## Data Science Process (iterative and order can vary)
- Domain discovery, goal identification, and question development
    + Drives mapping the problem space to the solution space
- Determine the type of problem and type of solution required
- Data extraction, collection, ETL, and pipeline architecture/development
    + Data sources: raw data, real time measurement, events, IoT, and so on
- Data munging/wrangling
    - Data parsing, cleaning, and tidying
    - Outlier detection and handling
    - Data processing, transformation, and aggregation
        + Includes feature scaling, normalization, and/or standardization
        + Categorical feature transformation and dummy variables
- Feature selection and feature engineering
- Data comsumption, exploratory data analysis (EDA), statistical analysis, descriptive analytics, and visualization
- Performance metric selection. Examples:
    + MSE and RMSE
    + R squared (aka explained variance)
    + Accuracy
    + Precision
    + Recall (aka sensitivity)
    + Receiver operator characteristic (ROC)
    + Area under the ROC curve (AUC)
    + F-score
- Data splitting
- Model selection, training, evaluation, validation, complexity reduction, and tuning
    + Iterative process and involves revisiting previous stages, including model selection
    + Model complexity reduction via subset selection, shrinkage methods, regularization (e.g., ridge regression and lasso), and dimensionality reduction
    + Ensemble methods exploration and implementation as needed for performance goals (e.g., bagging, boosting, random forests, and so on)
    + Model validation, resampling methods, and selection
        + Cross-validation
        + Bootstrap
        + Mallowâ€™s Cp
        + Akaike information criterion (AIC)
        + Bayesian information criterion (BIC)
    + Bias variance tradeoff and model complexity
        * Validation curve
        * Learning curve
        * Residual sum of squares
        * Goodness-of-fit metrics
    + Error analysis and tradeoffs
        * Type 1
        * Type 2

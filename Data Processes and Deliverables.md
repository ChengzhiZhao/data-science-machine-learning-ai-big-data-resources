# Processes - Data Science, Data Mining, Machine Learning, AI, Advanced Analytics

## Data Science Process
- Domain discovery, goal identification, and question development
    + Drives mapping the problem space to the solution space
- Data extraction, collection, ETL, and pipeline architecture/development
    + Data sources: raw data, real time measurement, events, IoT, and so on
- Data munging, cleaning, processing, transformation, and aggregation
    + Includes normalization and standardization
- Data comsumption, EDA, descriptive analytics, and visualization
- Feature selection and feature engineering
- Performance metric selection
- Model selection, training, validation, and tuning
    + Iterative process and involves revisiting previous stages
- Deliverables (see below)

## Data Science Deliverables

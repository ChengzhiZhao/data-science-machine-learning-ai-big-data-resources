# Processes - Data Science, Data Mining, Machine Learning, AI, Advanced Analytics

## Data Science Process (iterative and order can vary)
- Domain discovery, goal identification, and question development
    + Drives mapping the problem space to the solution space
- Data extraction, collection, ETL, and pipeline architecture/development
    + Data sources: raw data, real time measurement, events, IoT, and so on
- Data munging/wrangling
    - Data parsing, cleaning, and tidying
    - Outlier detection and handling
    - Data processing, transformation, and aggregation
        + Includes feature scaling, normalization, and/or standardization
        + Categorical feature transformation and dummy variables
- Feature selection and feature engineering
- Data comsumption, exploratory data analysis (EDA), statistical analysis, descriptive analytics, and visualization
- Performance metric selection. Examples:
    + Accuracy
    + Precision
    + Recall
    + Receiver operator characteristic (ROC)
- Data splitting
- Model selection, training, evaluation, validation, complexity reduction, and tuning
    + Iterative process and involves revisiting previous stages, including model selection
    + Model complexity reduction via subset selection, shrinkage methods, regularization (e.g., ridge regression and lasso), and dimensionality reduction
    + Ensemble methods exploration and implementation as needed for performance goals (e.g., bagging, boosting, random forests, and so on)
    + Model validation and resampling methods, including cross-validation, bootstrap, and so on
- Deliverables (see below)

## Data Science Deliverables
- Deep and actionable insights
    + Story telling
    + Reports
    + Dashboards
    + Visualizations

- Deployed analytics models and algorithms, including monitoring and performance measurement
- Analytics
    + Descriptive analytics - What happened and why?
    + Predictive analytics - What is the probability of something happening?
    + Prescriptive analytics - What specific recommendations will drive business decisions and help achieve business goals (i.e., what to do if 'X' happens)
- Machine learning and Artificial intelligence specific
